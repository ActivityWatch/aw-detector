aw-detector
===========

A simple client to aw-server that checks if the latest event in some bucket matches a pattern.

A good example of an application using aw-client.


# Idea

Would be cool if one could publish real-time "what am I doing now?" statuses using this.
For instance: "Erik is currently working on aw-server" or "Erik is currently playing Starcraft".
